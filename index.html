    <h2 class="display-6">About Me</h2>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p>I am currently a postdoctoral researcher with the <a href="https://www.uni-due.de/physik/twist/">TWIST Group</a> at the University of Duisburg-Essen, working, primarily investigating magnetic textures using numerical modelling. I was previously a PhD student at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.</p>
    <p>You can read my thesis <a href="http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-10397">here</a> and my CV <a href="./download/CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>

            <h3><a class="title" href="./posts/phdfigures/">Some Figures From My PhD</a></h3>
            Here is a small assortment of figures that I made during my PhD with the TWIST and INSPIRE groups, mainly for my thesis. I started to learn Blender shortly after the start of my PhD, but I ended up switching to POV-Ray, which is the tool used to create most of the images on this page (the only exception being the H-shaped skyrmion render, for which I used Blender). Although POV-Ray is significantly older and has fewer features than Blender, I have found it to be much more simple to use where more complex mathematics is required to describe an object (with Blender, I always felt like I was having to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; it in order to create what I wanted, even with the Python API).

            <h3><a class="title" href="./posts/udiophdsong/">AI Can Generate Pretty Good Music Now</a></h3>
            It seems like ChatGPT has been around forever now, and despite only having used it for a year or so, many people wonder how they ever lived without it. I recently discovered that a similar service exists for audio, where songs can be generated from a prompt. One example of such a service is Udio. At the time of writing, it is free to use, albeit with a limited (but generous) number of credits.

            <h3><a class="title" href="./posts/phdgraduation/">I Got My PhD!</a></h3>
            After years of work, my PhD journal has finally come to an end! I defended my thesis &ldquo;Creation and Manipulation of Topological Magnetic Textures in Chiral and Frustrated Magnets&rdquo; at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universit√§t Mainz on 14th May 2024, with the grade 1.0 (&ldquo;very good&rdquo;).

            <h3><a class="title" href="./posts/usa2022/">USA 2022</a></h3>
            Between June and August 2022, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Ran Cheng&rsquo;s group at the University of California, Riverside, to work on a (still ongoing, at time of writing) project. This post, however, is about the exciting things I got up to when I was not working!
The UCR Bell Tower.
Rather than flying directly to Los Angeles, I decided that I would book my flight to Seattle, a city that I had been wanting to visit for a good decade.

            <h3><a class="title" href="./posts/photography/">Photography</a></h3>
            <p>As a teenager, I was quite into photography, especially after my parents got me a Canon EOS 600D for Christmas when I was 15. Although I don&rsquo;t really do so much of this at the moment, here is a collection of photos that I have taken in various places around the world.</p>
