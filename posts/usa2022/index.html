<p>Between June and August 2022, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Ran Cheng&rsquo;s group at the University of California, Riverside, to work on a (still ongoing, at time of writing) project. This post, however, is about the exciting things I got up to when I was not working!</p>

<p>Rather than flying directly to Los Angeles, I decided that I would book my flight to Seattle, a city that I had been wanting to visit for a good decade. I would then take the Amtrak down to Portland, another city I&rsquo;d been dreaming of going to for a good while, and then further onwards to Los Angeles and Riverside. I flew with Condor, and the flight was a pretty nice experience. On the way, I got a nice view of Mainz, the city I called home for the first year and a half of my PhD.</p>

<p>The plane&rsquo;s vegan meal was pretty fancy, even though I had to pay extra for it (I even got metal cutlery!).</p>

<p>From the plane, there was also a nice view of Seattle&rsquo;s skyline.</p>

<p>I had wanted to do some hiking in Seattle, as I had seen pictures and videos of the Pacific Northwest&rsquo;s amazing scenery, and I wanted to experience it for myself. Unfortunately, most hiking trails around Seattle are not so easily accessible with public transport. On weekends in the summer, however, there is a shuttle bus that takes you directly from the centre of Seattle to the nearby Mount Si, so I didn&rsquo;t have to miss out! I ended up joining a group of Amazon interns and hiking up to Teneriffe Falls. Around this area, there are some amazing viewpoints, like that shown in the picture below.</p>

<p>One thing not to be missed in Seattle is Kerry Park, which offers a view over the city&rsquo;s skyline. I timed my trip perfectly with the sunset and watched the city turn golden as the sun went down after an otherwise fairly gloomy day.</p>

<p>I had wanted to see more of the West Coast than just Seattle and Riverside, so I took the train from Seattle to Portland with the intention of staying in Portland for a few nights and then moving on further.</p>
<figure><img src="PortlandTrain.jpg"
         alt="The view out of the window on the train between Seattle and Portland."/><figcaption>

<p>Portland was a fun city, and although I got the sense that there was less going on than in Seattle, I preferred the city as it felt, at least from my perspective, safer, and it generally seemed more green.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the couple of days I spent exploring the city and was able to visit the world&rsquo;s smallest park: Mill Ends Park, which is essentially just a bush on a traffic island, despite officially being designated as a park.</p>
<figure><img src="MillEndsPark.jpg"

<p>After my couple of nights in Portland, I had intended to take the Pacific Surfliner down to San Luis Obispo, a 25-hour train journey, where I would stay overnight, before taking another train to Los Angeles, and then to Riverside. However, on the morning I was due to make this journey, I woke up with a sore throat and a blocked nose. I had to go to the supermarket to get some food, and I decided to grab a Covid test. When I got back to my hostel, I took the test, and, lo and behold, it was positive.</p>

         alt="Oh no!"/><figcaption>
            <p>Oh no!</p>

<p>Fortunately, the staff at the hostel I was staying in, the HI Northwest Portland, handled the situation excellently and put me in my own room. I stayed in here for another week feeling sorry for myself, before finally taking a flight to Ontario International Airport, and arriving in Riverside.</p>

<p>Southern California was very different from what I am used to, and I used the weekends to do some exploring. Around Riverside, there were some very nice hiking trails, including the Two Trees Trail, shown in the photograph below.</p>

<p>One thing that I can certainly recommend trying in Southern California is Mexican-style fruits from the many street vendors. They put some delicious sauce and seasoning on them - very refreshing after a long hike in the heat!</p>

<p>On one weekend, I took a trip to nearby Los Angeles, where I hiked past the Griffith Observatory and around to the Hollywood Sign. The picture below is taken from the point which is the closest you can get to the sign itself.</p>

<p>On Sundays, there is a market south-east of Downtown LA called Smorgasburg, which has an amazing variety of foods, with lots of vegan options. When I was on the bus into LA from Riverside, the guy sitting next to me had told me that I need to try chicken and waffles at some point. Being vegan, I mentally dismissed this, but I found a very good vegan version of this dish at one of the stands!</p>

<p>In general, I found Southern California to have a thriving live music scene. In Riverside, I went to see New Found Glory and Four Year Strong at the Riverside Municipal Auditorium. My 17-year-old self would have been very pleased!</p>

<p>On another weekend, I went with some very cool people I had met before whilst hiking on a drive through Los Angeles to Malibu. The road along the coast looked straight out of a holiday brochure!</p>

<p>Towards the end of my trip, I went with one of the other PhD students in Ran&rsquo;s group to Joshua Tree, a national park to the east of Riverside, where there were lots of interesting rock formations, like Arch Rock, shown below.</p>
<figure><img src="JoshuaTree.jpg"

<p>Finally, after two and a half very fun and interesting months, I returned home to Duisburg.</p>
