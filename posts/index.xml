      <title>Managing an Ever-Changing File Structure with Org Mode as a Lab Notebook</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Emacs is often described as a text editor, but it is more than that. Personally, I do not generally use Emacs as a code editor (at time of writing, I tend to use Vim and Visual Studio Code), but I instead use it for its &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;Org Mode&lt;/a&gt;. This post is not, however, an evangelisation of Org Mode (many other people have done a much better job at this than I could do, see e.g. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea_-TaEGa7Y&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), but rather a description of how I solved an issue I had relating to hyperlinking to simulation data when writing Org Mode documents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, I was quite into photography, especially after my parents got me a Canon EOS 600D for Christmas when I was 15. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t really do so much of this at the moment, here is a collection of photos that I have taken in various places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up Inverse Search with Neovim, VimTeX and Zathura</title>

      <description>There are many reasons to write LaTeX in Vim instead of the more &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; LaTeX editors. Maybe you want to type long equations quickly with the help of UltiSnips, or you just want to make the most of Vim&amp;rsquo;s many features. VimTeX is a plugin for Vim (and Neovim) which allows for the easy authoring of LaTeX files using Vim, with useful features such as autocompilation, and Zathura is a minimalist, highly customisable document viewer with Vim keybindings by default.</description>
