      <title>Some Figures From My PhD</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a small assortment of figures that I made during my PhD with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.uni-due.de/physik/twist/&#34;&gt;TWIST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sinova-group.physik.uni-mainz.de/&#34;&gt;INSPIRE&lt;/a&gt; groups, mainly for my &lt;a href=&#34;http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-10397&#34;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt;. I started to learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blender.org/&#34;&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the start of my PhD, but I ended up switching to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.povray.org/&#34;&gt;POV-Ray&lt;/a&gt;, which is the tool used to create most of the images on this page (the only exception being the H-shaped skyrmion render, for which I used Blender). Although POV-Ray is significantly older and has fewer features than Blender, I have found it to be much more simple to use where more complex mathematics is required to describe an object (with Blender, I always felt like I was having to &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; it in order to create what I wanted, even with the Python API).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI Can Generate Pretty Good Music Now</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like ChatGPT has been around forever now, and despite only having used it for a year or so, many people wonder how they ever lived without it. I recently discovered that a similar service exists for audio, where songs can be generated from a prompt. One example of such a service is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udio.com/&#34;&gt;Udio&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of writing, it is free to use, albeit with a limited (but generous) number of credits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After years of work, my PhD journal has finally come to an end! I defended my thesis &amp;ldquo;Creation and Manipulation of Topological Magnetic Textures in Chiral and Frustrated Magnets&amp;rdquo; at the Johannes Gutenberg-Universit√§t Mainz on 14th May 2024, with the grade 1.0 (&amp;ldquo;very good&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read my thesis &lt;a href=&#34;http://doi.org/10.25358/openscience-10397&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../posts/phdgraduation/defence.jpg&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <title>USA 2022</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Between June and August 2022, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Ran Cheng&amp;rsquo;s group at the University of California, Riverside, to work on a (still ongoing, at time of writing) project. This post, however, is about the exciting things I got up to when I was not working!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../posts/usa2022/UCR.jpg&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;The UCR Bell Tower.&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;The UCR Bell Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than flying directly to Los Angeles, I decided that I would book my flight to Seattle, a city that I had been wanting to visit for a good decade. I would then take the Amtrak down to Portland, another city I&amp;rsquo;d been dreaming of going to for a good while, and then further onwards to Los Angeles and Riverside. I flew with Condor, and the flight was a pretty nice experience. On the way, I got a nice view of Mainz, the city I called home for the first year and a half of my PhD.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Photography</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, I was quite into photography, especially after my parents got me a Canon EOS 600D for Christmas when I was 15. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t really do so much of this at the moment, here is a collection of photos that I have taken in various places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up Inverse Search with Neovim, VimTeX and Zathura</title>
      <link>https://www.rossknapman.com/posts/nvimvimtexzathura/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note 06.01.2023: With the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/releases/tag/v2.8&#34;&gt;release of VimTex 2.8&lt;/a&gt;, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need to do this any more. See &lt;code&gt;:help vimtex-synctex-inverse-search&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to write LaTeX in Vim instead of the more &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; LaTeX editors. Maybe you want to type long equations quickly with the help of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips&#34;&gt;UltiSnips&lt;/a&gt;, or you just want to make the most of Vim&amp;rsquo;s many features. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lervag/vimtex&#34;&gt;VimTeX&lt;/a&gt; is a plugin for Vim (and Neovim) which allows for the easy authoring of LaTeX files using Vim, with useful features such as autocompilation, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/&#34;&gt;Zathura&lt;/a&gt; is a minimalist, highly customisable document viewer with Vim keybindings by default.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made this animation using Blender when writing my project proposal for my Studienstiftung application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwIhokjgho8?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;Coffee Mug to Doughnut&#34;&#xA;      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;</description>
