      <description>Between June and August 2022, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Ran Cheng&amp;rsquo;s group at the University of California, Riverside, to work on a (still ongoing, at time of writing) project. This post, however, is about the exciting things I got up to when I was not working!
 The UCR Bell Tower.
  Rather than flying directly to Los Angeles, I decided that I would book my flight to Seattle, a city that I had been wanting to visit for a good decade.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, I was quite into photography, especially after my parents got me a Canon EOS 600D for Christmas when I was 15. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t really do so much of this at the moment, here is a collection of photos that I have taken in various places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up Inverse Search with Neovim, VimTeX and Zathura</title>

      <description>There are many reasons to write LaTeX in Vim instead of the more &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; LaTeX editors. Maybe you want to type long equations quickly with the help of UltiSnips, or you just want to make the most of Vim&amp;rsquo;s many features. VimTeX is a plugin for Vim (and Neovim) which allows for the easy authoring of LaTeX files using Vim, with useful features such as autocompilation, and Zathura is a minimalist, highly customisable document viewer with Vim keybindings by default.</description>

      <description>Basics  The tilde key (at least when I was using an external keyboard) gives you a perspective menu.
 Shift+S gives you the cursor menu, allowing you to place the 3D cursor back at the origin, for example (this is where new objects spawn).
 Shift+RMB moves the 3D cursor
 You can create new panes by clicking and dragging the corners to drag out new panes, and merge them together in a similar way.</description>

      <description>Constants and Variables  Can either define a constant like const double pi = 3.14 or as a preprocessor director #define PI 3.14, where the latter replaces all appearances of PI in the source code with 3.14
 Declaration of variables: int x = 0; and int x(0); and int x{0}; are all equivalent
 x = x + 1; and x += 1 and ++x and x++ are all equivalent, but y = ++x will first add 1 to x, then assign this to y, whilst y = x++ will first set y = x, then add 1 to x</description>

      <description>On the first computer, go to Preferences. Tick &amp;#34;Load preferences from a custom folder or URL&amp;#34;. Browse to where the folder should be saved (e.g. in Dropbox) - this should be its own folder (so create a folder called iTerm or something). On the second computer. Load this folder, then restart iTerm. Then the &amp;#34;Load preferencesâ€¦&amp;#34; box can be unticked.
 For Alt+Left etc., go to Preferences, Profiles, Keys, and load the preset &amp;#34;Natural Text Editing&amp;#34;</description>

      <description>If things are not opening, try running echo $DISPLAY on the server. If nothing comes up, a possible fix on macOS is to install XQuartz, run launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchAgents/org.macosforge.xquartz.startx.plist on the Mac, then restart the computer. For debugging, try using ssh -v -X &amp;lt;e.g. WS2&amp;gt;.
 To open the Seafile GUI remotely (annoyingly, the GUI allows adjusting some settings that the CLI does not have), run seafile-applet.</description>

      <description>I canâ€™t find the text align button, to align the text within the text box  It shows up when youâ€™re typing the text itself, then goes away, contrary to with older versions.
  Extensions are not shown in the Extensions menu  First, make sure youâ€™re looking in the right place. For example, Tex Text was hidden under the Text menu, and when I searched for it, I typed it as one word, so it didnâ€™t show up.</description>

      <description>Overlapping Regions  Say we have the default region 0, some region 1, and some region 2 that is within region 1. If we set Ku1 = 1e4, then do Ku1.SetRegion(1, 1e5), then region 2 will take 1e4. If, on the other hand, we do Ku1.SetRegion(0, 1e4) and `Ku1.SetRegion(1e5), then region 2 will take 0. To get region 2 to match with region 1, we have to separately call Ku1.</description>

All recipes are vegan, except where I have added a note on what to change to make it vegan, or where it is obvious (e.g. cheese to vegan cheese; butter to vegan butter or spread).
