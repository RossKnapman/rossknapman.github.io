      <description>Between June and August 2022, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Ran Cheng&amp;rsquo;s group at the University of California, Riverside, to work on a (still ongoing, at time of writing) project.

Although I don&amp;rsquo;t really do so much of this at the moment, here is a collection of photos that I have taken in various places around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
